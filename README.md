A *Discord* bot that prepares computer science students for their career by providing commands to receive a link to a random technical interview coding problem from *LeetCode*, a data structures trivia question from *Tutorialspoint* and *Career Guru 99*, and alerts about new career opportunities from *Indeed*. The bot allows the users in the *Discord* server to collaborate on coding questions, which builds a community in which peers can discuss and encourage each other for interview preparation.
