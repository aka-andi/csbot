A Discord bot that prepares computer science students for their career by providing commands to receive a link to a random technical interview coding problem from LeetCode, a data structures trivia question from Hackernoon, and alerts about new career opportunities from LinkedIn. The bot allows the users in the Discord server to collaborate on coding questions, which builds a community in which peers can discuss and encourage each other for interview preparation.
