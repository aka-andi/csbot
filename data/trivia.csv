What is Data Structure? Explain.,"The data structure is a way that specifies how to organize and manipulate the data. It also defines the relationship between them. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are the central part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way"
Which data structure is used to perform recursion?,Stack data structure is used in recursion due to its last in first out nature. Operating system maintains the stack in order to save the iteration variables at each function call
What is a Stack?,"Stack is an ordered list in which, insertion and deletion can be performed only at one end that is called the top. It is a recursive data structure having pointer to its top element. The stack is sometimes called as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) list i.e. the element which is inserted first in the stack will be deleted last from the stack."
Write the stack overflow condition.,Overflow occurs when top = Maxsize -1
What is the difference between PUSH and POP?,PUSH and POP operations specify how data is stored and retrieved in a stack.
What is a postfix expression?,An expression in which operators follow the operands is known as postfix expression. The main benefit of this form is that there is no need to group sub-expressions in parentheses or to consider operator precedence.
Write the postfix form of the expression: (A + B) * (C - D),AB+CD-*
Which notations are used in Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions using prefix and postfix forms?,Polish and Reverse Polish notations.
What is an array?,Arrays are defined as the collection of similar types of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure in which each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number.
How to reference all the elements in a one-dimension array?,"It can be done by using an indexed loop such that the counter runs from 0 to the array size minus one. In this manner, you can reference all the elements in sequence by using the loop counter as the array subscript."
What is a multidimensional array?,"The multidimensional array can be defined as the array of arrays in which, the data is stored in tabular form consists of rows and columns. 2D arrays are created to implement a relational database lookalike data structure. It provides ease of holding the bulk of data at once which can be passed to any number of functions wherever required."
How are the elements of a 2D array are stored in the memory?,"There are two techniques by using which, the elements of a 2D array can be stored in the memory."
"Calculate the address of a random element present in a 2D array, given base address as BA.","Row-Major Order: If array is declared as a[m][n] where m is the number of rows while n is the number of columns, then address of an element a[i][j] of the array stored in row major order is calculated as,"
Define Linked List Data structure.,"Linked List is the collection of randomly stored data objects called nodes. In Linked List, each node is linked to its adjacent node through a pointer. A node contains two fields, i.e. Data Field and Link Field."
Are linked lists considered linear or non-linear data structures?,A linked list is considered both linear and non-linear data structure depending upon the situation.
What are the advantages of Linked List over an array?,Dynamic size and ease of insertion/deletion.
"If you are using C language to implement the heterogeneous linked list, what pointer type should be used?","The heterogeneous linked list contains different data types, so it is not possible to use ordinary pointers for this. For this purpose, you have to use a generic pointer type like void pointer because the void pointer is capable of storing a pointer to any type."
Define the queue data structure.,A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.
What is a dequeue?,"Dequeue (also known as double-ended queue) can be defined as an ordered set of elements in which the insertion and deletion can be performed at both the ends, i.e. front and rear."
What is the minimum number of queues that can be used to implement a priority queue?,"Two queues are needed. One queue is used to store the data elements, and another is used for storing priorities."
Define the tree data structure.,The Tree is a recursive data structure containing the set of one or more data nodes where one node is designated as the root of the tree while the remaining nodes are called as the children of the root. The nodes other than the root node are partitioned into the nonempty sets where each one of them is to be called sub-tree.
What are Binary trees?,"A binary Tree is a special type of generic tree in which, each node can have at most two children. Binary tree is generally partitioned into three disjoint subsets, i.e. the root of the node, left sub-tree and Right binary sub-tree."
What is the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height k?,2k+1-1 where k >= 1
Which data structure suits the most in the tree construction?,Queue data structure
How can AVL Tree be useful in all the operations as compared to Binary search tree?,"AVL tree controls the height of the binary search tree by not letting it be skewed. The time taken for all operations in a binary search tree of height h is O(h). However, it can be extended to O(n) if the BST becomes skewed (i.e. worst case). By limiting this height to log n, AVL tree imposes an upper bound on each operation to be O(log n) where n is the number of nodes."
State the properties of B Tree.,"A B tree of order m contains all the properties of an M way tree. In addition, it contains the following properties."
Define the graph data structure?,"A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent-child relations."
"In what scenario, Binary Search can be used?",Binary Search algorithm is used to search an already sorted list. The algorithm follows divide and conqer approach
What are the advantages of Binary search over linear search?,"There are relatively less number of comparisons in binary search than that in linear search. In average case, linear search takes O(n) time to search a list of n elements while Binary search takes O(log n) time to search a list of n elements."
What is data-structure?,"Data structure is a way of defining, storing & retriving of data in a structural & systemetic way. A data structure may contain different type of data items."
What are various data-structures available?,"Data structure availability may vary by programming languages. Commonly available data structures are list, arrays, stack, queues, graph, tree etc."
What is algorithm?,"Algorithm is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output."
Why we need to do algorithm analysis?,"A problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm."
What are the criteria of algorithm analysis?,"An algorithm are generally analyzed on two factors − time and space. That is, how much execution time and how much extra space required by the algorithm."

Briefly explain the approaches to develop algorithms.,Dynamic Programming − diving the problem to a minimum possible sub-problem and solving them combinedly
What is a linked-list?,"A linked-list is a list of data-items connected with links i.e. pointers or references. Most modern high-level programming language does not provide the feature of directly accessing memory location, therefore, linked-list are not supported in them or available in form of inbuilt functions."
What is stack?,"In data-structure, stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) used to store and retrieve values in Last In First Out method."
Why do we use stacks?,"Stacks follows LIFO method and addition and retrieval of a data item takes only Ο(n) time. Stacks are used where we need to access data in the reverse order or their arrival. Stacks are used commonly in recursive function calls, expression parsing, depth first traversal of graphs etc."
What is a queue in data-structure?,"Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to stack. In contrast to stack, queue is opened at both end. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first."
Why do we use queues?,"As queues follows FIFO method, they are used when we need to work on data-items in exact sequence of their arrival. Every operating system maintains queues of various processes. Priority queues and breadth first traversal of graphs are some examples of queues."
What is linear searching?,"Linear search tries to find an item in a sequentially arranged data type. These sequentially arranged data items known as array or list, are accessible in incrementing memory location. Linear search compares expected data item with each of data items in list or array. The average case time complexity of linear search is Ο(n) and worst case complexity is Ο(n2). Data in target arrays/lists need not to be sorted."
What is bubble sort and how bubble sort works?,"Bubble sort is comparison based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and elements are swapped if they are not in order. Because the time complexity is Ο(n2), it is not suitable for large set of data."
Tell me something about 'insertion sort'?,"Insertion sort divides the list into two sub-list, sorted and unsorted. It takes one element at time and finds it appropriate location in sorted sub-list and insert there. The output after insertion is a sorted sub-list. It iteratively works on all the elements of unsorted sub-list and inserts them to sorted sub-list in order."
What is selection sort?,Selection sort is in-place sorting technique. It divides the data set into two sub-lists: sorted and unsorted. Then it selects the minimum element from unsorted sub-list and places it into the sorted list. This iterates unless all the elements from unsorted sub-list are consumed into sorted sub-list.
How insertion sort and selection sorts are different?,"Both sorting techniques maintains two sub-lists, sorted and unsorted and both take one element at a time and places it into sorted sub-list. Insertion sort works on the current element in hand and places it in the sorted array at appropriate location maintaining the properties of insertion sort. Whereas, selection sort searches the minimum from the unsorted sub-list and replaces it with the current element in hand."
What is merge sort and how it works?,Merge sort is sorting algorithm based on divide and conquer programming approach. It keeps on dividing the list into smaller sub-list until all sub-list has only 1 element. And then it merges them in a sorted way until all sub-lists are consumed. It has run-time complexity of Ο(n log n) and it needs Ο(n) auxiliary space.
What is shell sort?,"Shell sort can be said a variant of insertion sort. Shell sort divides the list into smaller sublist based on some gap variable and then each sub-list is sorted using insertion sort. In best cases, it can perform upto Ο(n log n)."
How quick sort works?,Quick sort uses divide and conquer approach. It divides the list in smaller 'partitions' using 'pivot'. The values which are smaller than the pivot are arranged in the left partition and greater values are arranged in the right partition. Each partition is recursively sorted using quick sort.
What is a graph?,"A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges."
How depth first traversal works?,Depth First Search algorithm(DFS) traverses a graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search when a dead end occurs in any iteration.
How breadth first traversal works?,Breadth First Search algorithm(BFS) traverses a graph in a breadthwards motion and uses a queue to remember to get the next vertex to start a search when a dead end occurs in any iteration.

What is a binary tree?,A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have two children at maximum.
What is a binary search tree?,A binary search tree is a binary tree with a special provision where a node's left child must have value less than its parent's value and node's right child must have value greater than it's parent value.
What is an AVL Tree?,AVL trees are height balancing binary search tree. AVL tree checks the height of left and right sub-trees and assures that the difference is not more than 1. This difference is called Balance Factor.
What is a spanning tree?,"A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. A spanning tree does not have cycles and it can not be disconnected."
How many spanning trees can a graph has?,"It depends on how connected the graph is. A complete undirected graph can have maximum nn-1 number of spanning trees, where n is number of nodes."
How Kruskal's algorithm works?,This algorithm treats the graph as a forest and every node it as an individual tree. A tree connects to another only and only if it has least cost among all available options and does not violate MST properties.
How Prim's algorithm finds spanning tree?,Prim's algorithm treats the nodes as a single tree and keeps on adding new nodes to the spanning tree from the given graph.
What is a minimum spanning tree (MST)?,"In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight that all other spanning trees of the same graph."
What is a heap in data structure?,"Heap is a special balanced binary tree data structure where root-node key is compared with its children and arranged accordingly. A min-heap, a parent node has key value less than its childs and a max-heap parent node has value greater than its childs."
What is a recursive function?,"A recursive function is one which calls itself, directly or calls a function that in turn calls it. Every recursive function follows the recursive properties − base criteria where functions stops calling itself and progressive approach where the functions tries to meet the base criteria in each iteration."
What is tower of hanoi?,"Tower of Hanoi, is a mathematical puzzle which consists of three tower (pegs) and more than one rings. All rings are of different size and stacked upon each other where the large disk is always below the small disk. The aim is to move the tower of disk from one peg to another, without breaking its properties."
